- The failing test is `ArchitectureTest` using ArchUnit, which validates architectural rules.
- The specific failing rule is `NO_JENKINS_INSTANCE_CALL` from `PluginArchitectureRules`.
- This rule forbids calling `Jenkins.getInstance()` and similar methods directly outside a designated class (`JenkinsFacade`).

## Failure Details

- The class causing failure is `io.jenkins.plugins.okhttp.api.JenkinsOkHttpClient`.
- This class calls `Jenkins.get()` directly, violating the architectural rule.
- The test failure shows an `AssertionError` due to this violation.

## Dependency Relation

- The failing class (`JenkinsOkHttpClient`) appears to be part of the **clientâ€™s own code**, not the `github-api` dependency.
- However, changing the version of the `github-api` dependency can influence the test outcome, likely because:
  - Different versions may affect code or behavior in the client project.
  - The presence or absence of certain classes/methods or their changes can trigger the architecture rule.

## Key Points

| Aspect                       | Description                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Failing Test                 | `ArchitectureTest` (ArchUnit)                                     |
| Violated Rule                | `NO_JENKINS_INSTANCE_CALL`                                        |
| Offending Class              | `io.jenkins.plugins.okhttp.api.JenkinsOkHttpClient` (client code) |
| Dependency Impact            | `github-api` version changes can affect test pass/fail status    |

## Conclusion

- The failure is due to client code violating architectural rules by calling Jenkins singleton methods directly.
- Dependency version changes can indirectly influence this failure.
- To fix the failure, refactor the offending code to comply with the architectural rules.
