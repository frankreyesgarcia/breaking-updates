These tests failed while loading or interpreting model instances via JSON.  
The `net.minidev.json.parser.ParseException` was triggered due to **malicious or overly deep JSON structures**, which were stopped at specific character positions.

> All of the following failed with:
> ```
> net.minidev.json.parser.ParseException: Malicious payload, having non natural depths, parsing stoped on { at position XXXXX
> ```

### Affected Tests:
- `IssuesTest.testIssue100`
- `IssuesTest.testIssue101`

### diff

The JSON parsing failures in the tests `testIssue100` and `testIssue101` indicate that the input JSON structures were either too complex or maliciously crafted, leading to a `ParseException`. This suggests that the JSON parser has safeguards against overly deep or complex structures, which can be a common issue in security-sensitive applications.
```diff
- // Previously no depth checking
- readObject(...) {
-    // parse nested objects recursively without depth limit
- }

+ // Added depth checking and validation against malicious payloads
+ readObject(...) {
+    if (currentDepth > MAX_ALLOWED_DEPTH) {
+        throw new ParseException("Malicious payload, having non natural depths...");
+    }
+    // parse nested objects recursively with strict depth limit
+ }
```
